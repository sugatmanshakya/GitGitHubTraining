Hello, my name is Sugat Man Shakya,
Talking about my experience in this 3-day long training session, the impact was positive.
I enjoyed every bit of contents delivered by my trainer which was in an intellectual manner. 
In this session I learned a lot of things about Git & Git Hub. 
The workshop itself has been really fruitful and useful for me to learn and develop my skills.

Thank You.
